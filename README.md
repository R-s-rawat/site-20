# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Make changes and test them locally.
When you've completed a logical unit of work, stage the changes (git add .).
Commit the changes with a descriptive message (git commit -m "Your Commit Message").
Push your changes to the remote repository when you're ready to share them with others (git push origin <branch_name>).
